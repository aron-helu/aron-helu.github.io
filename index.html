        <h1>Eritrea Dishes Recipes</h1>
        <p>Eritrea is a northeast African country on the Red Sea coast. It shares borders with Ethiopia, Sudan and Djibouti. The capital city, Asmara, is known for its Italian colonial buildings, like St. Joseph's Cathedral, as well as art deco structures. Italian, Egyptian and Turkish architecture in Massawa reflect the port city's colorful history. Notable buildings here include St. Mariam Cathedral and the Imperial Palace.</p>
        <p>Ethiopians and Eritreans eat exclusively with their right hands, using pieces of injera to pick up bites of entr√©es and side dishes. Utensils are rarely used with Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisine.</p>
